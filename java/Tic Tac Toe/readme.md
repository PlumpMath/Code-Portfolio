# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

**Tic-Tac-Toe** was written for a final project for my *intermediate Java class.* It is a two-player tic-tac-toe game that utilizes the *Java Swing GUI*. It creates a gameboard with a 3x3 grid of buttons and a label at the top of game board to inform the players whose turns it is and the outcome of the game.
